# 💼 CareerHub – Intelligent Job Application Platform  
Enabling applicants to apply, track, and manage job opportunities effortlessly.

## 🔍 Overview  
Job seekers often struggle with repetitive applications, scattered job statuses, and a lack of clarity about where they stand. **CareerHub** solves this by centralizing the job search process — from profile creation to application tracking — all in one smart platform.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it supports role-based access for applicants and admins with real-time resume storage and dynamic dashboards.
